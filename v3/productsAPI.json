<p> At fabric, the term Product refers to an Item, Variant, and/or Bundle. Items are stand-alone and sold individually. Variants are the different variations of an item. For example, a Laptop that comes in three different sizes (13”, 15”, 17”) and four different colors (red, blue, grey, and white) has 12 variations. Variants are nested under a parent item, allowing the different options to appear for the item on the Storefront. Bundles are collections of two or more products sold exclusively together or as individual products.<p>Products API enables you to create items, add variants to an item, create a bundle, add items to a bundle, update product attributes, get details of one or more products, delete products, find products, and more.\n\nContact Support:\n Name: Product Team\n Email: support@fabric.inc","type":"text/plain"}}}}
